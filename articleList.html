          You start creating rocket designs. You work from a blank sheet of
          paper. In fact, you get a lot of blank sheets of paper. Reams of
          paper, really. The challenge, it turns out, is not to design a rocket
          capable of supporting human missions to Mars. The challenge is
          designing the BEST rocket for the mission.

          <img src="./aircraft.jpg" />
          The aircraft design process is a loosely defined method used to
          balance many competing and demanding requirements to produce an
          aircraft that is strong, lightweight, economical and can carry an
          adequate payload while being sufficiently reliable to safely fly for
          the design life of the aircraft.

          Automotive design is the process of developing the appearance, and to
          some extent the ergonomics, of motor vehicles. First, it is a matter
          of understanding the future vehicle and the context in which it will
          be driven. BMW’s designers initially express their ideas in countless
          hand-drawn sketches. These models are made from clay.

          <img src="./spaceshuttle.jpeg" />
          During the early shuttle studies, there was a debate over the optimal
          shuttle design that best balanced capability, development cost, and
          operational cost. Initially a fully reusable design was preferred.
          This involved a very large winged manned booster which would carry a
          smaller winged manned orbiter.

          <img src="./train.jpg" />
          Train design is the foundation of successful service, affecting
          everything from travel time to cost to passenger experience. The train
          equipment itself affects everything that matters to both riders and
          operators: comfort, speed, safety, operating costs, ridership and
          revenue. Design is very important to shape the future of trains.

          For the last few months, we’ve been diligently working to completely
          redraw the Queens Bus Network to create a faster, more reliable system
          of interconnected routes. To do this, we wiped the map clean and
          started from scratch, which means there are a lot of changes proposed
          in this proposed Draft Plan.
